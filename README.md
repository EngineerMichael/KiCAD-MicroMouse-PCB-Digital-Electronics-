KiCad-MicroMouse-PCB-Digital-Electronics



Overview



KiCad-MicroMouse-PCB-Digital-Electronics is an open-source project aimed at designing and creating a MicroMouse PCB for digital electronics applications. This project utilizes KiCad, a powerful open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool, to create the schematic and PCB layout for the MicroMouse — a small robotic system that autonomously navigates a maze. The design includes components for sensors, actuators, and a microcontroller for controlling the movement and navigation.



This project is part of an IEEE-based initiative to promote learning in digital electronics, embedded systems, and robotics, offering a hands-on approach to designing and building a functional MicroMouse robot.



The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.



Features

• MicroMouse Design: A complete design for a MicroMouse robot capable of navigating mazes autonomously.

• KiCad Schematic & PCB Layout: All designs are created using KiCad, with all files (schematic, PCB layout, and BOM) included.

• Sensor Integration: The MicroMouse integrates various sensors for maze detection and navigation, including infrared sensors for distance measurement and obstacle avoidance.

• Motor and Driver Circuitry: Motor drivers for controlling the wheels and actuators, allowing the MicroMouse to move through the maze.

• Microcontroller: A microcontroller-based system to process sensor data and make decisions for autonomous movement.

• Power Supply Circuit: A power management system to power the sensors, motors, and microcontroller.

• IEEE Educational Focus: This project is designed to provide practical experience for students and hobbyists in the field of digital electronics and embedded systems.

• Open Source: All design files, schematics, and source code are freely available under the GNU General Public License v3.0, ensuring the project is fully open for modification and redistribution.



Installation



Prerequisites



Before starting with the project, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

• KiCad: The primary EDA tool used for designing the schematic and PCB layout.

• Download KiCad from the official site: KiCad Downloads

• Gerber Viewer: For inspecting the final PCB design files (optional but recommended). You can use tools like Gerbv or any other Gerber viewer.

• Soldering Kit: For assembling the PCB after manufacturing.



Steps to Download and Set Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KiCad-MicroMouse-PCB-Digital-Electronics.git

cd KiCad-MicroMouse-PCB-Digital-Electronics



2. Open the KiCad project:

• Open KiCad, and then open the project file MicroMouse.kicad_pro to begin working on the design.

3. Review the schematic:

• In KiCad, open the schematic file MicroMouse.sch to review the design of the circuit and components.

4. Review the PCB layout:

• Open the PCB layout file MicroMouse.kicad_pcb to view the physical layout of the components on the PCB.

5. Build the project:

• KiCad allows you to generate Gerber files, which can be sent to a PCB manufacturer for fabrication. Use the Plot option in KiCad to create Gerber files for manufacturing.

• Additionally, you can generate a Bill of Materials (BOM) and pick-and-place files for assembly.



Usage



1. Design Overview



The design consists of several key sections:

• Microcontroller Unit (MCU): The brain of the MicroMouse robot, which processes inputs from sensors and controls outputs to motors and actuators.

• Sensor Circuitry: Includes infrared sensors for detecting walls and obstacles within the maze.

• Motor Drivers: A motor driver circuit to control the movement of the wheels based on signals from the microcontroller.

• Power Supply: A power management system that regulates power for the MCU, sensors, and motors.



2. Building the PCB



Once you have reviewed and customized the schematic and PCB layout, the next steps are:

• Generate Gerber Files: After finalizing the PCB design, use KiCad to generate Gerber files for the PCB. These files are used by PCB manufacturers to fabricate the board.

Steps:

• Open the PCB layout in KiCad.

• Go to File > Plot and select the necessary options to generate the Gerber files.

• Export the files to your chosen folder.

• Order the PCB: After generating the Gerber files, you can send them to a PCB manufacturer (such as JLCPCB, PCBWay, etc.) to fabricate the board.

• Assembly: After receiving the PCB, you can assemble the board by soldering the components onto the PCB. Ensure to follow the component values and connections from the schematic.



3. Programming the Microcontroller



The MicroMouse is controlled by a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, STM32, or any suitable microcontroller). After assembling the PCB:

1. Install the Firmware: Write and upload the firmware that controls the behavior of the MicroMouse. This firmware will include algorithms for:

• Maze exploration.

• Wall detection using infrared sensors.

• Motor control for movement.

2. Test the MicroMouse: Once the firmware is uploaded, place the MicroMouse in a maze and observe how it autonomously solves the maze.



4. Testing the Design

• Visualizing the PCB Layout: You can use a Gerber Viewer to inspect the final PCB design and verify that it is as expected before manufacturing.

• Circuit Simulation: If you wish to simulate the circuit before building it, KiCad offers simulation tools such as ngspice, which can be used to verify the behavior of the electronic components.
